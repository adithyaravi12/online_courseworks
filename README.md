## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### [Black Jack game using JavaScript](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/scrimba/black-jack)
**Code:** [`index.html`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/scrimba/black-jack/index.html)    
**Description:** While learning javascript from scratch, I created a very simple version of black jack.  
**Technology:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Results:** Working game rendered with basic gameplay

### [Generate random passwords using JavaScript](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/scrimba/black-jack)
**Code:** [`index.html`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/scrimba/generate-passwords/index.html)    
**Description:**   This was scrimba's second solo project while learning javascript from the ground up. The project is built from the scratch using the template provided and displays randomly generated passwords with the click of a button.  
**Technology:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Results:** Displays passwords that are randomly generated with a click of a button

### [Color picker using OpenCV](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/color-picker)
**Code:** [`colorpicker.py`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/color-picker/colorpicker.py)    
**Description:** With some help, I was able to program a color picker while learning opencv from the base up.  
**Technology:** Python, OpenCV  
**Results:** Displays 3 windows, one of an original image, second is a window toolbar and third is the color picked image

### [Shape detection using OpenCV](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/shape-detection)
**Code:** [`shapedetection.py`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/shape-detection/shapedetection.py)    
**Description:** With some help, I was able to program a shape detector while learning opencv from the base up.  
**Technology:** Python, OpenCV  
**Results:** Maps around the shape, and display the name of the shape on top of it

### [Text detection using OpenCV](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/text-detection)
**Code:** [`text-detection.py`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/opencv%20%40%20youtube/text-detection/text-detection.py)    
**Description:** With some help, I was able to program a text detector while learning opencv from the base up.  
**Technology:** Python, OpenCV  
**Results:** Maps around the text, and display the content of the text that has been detected on top of it

### [Calculate Order History](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/amazon-bill)
**Code:** [`amazon_order_history.ipynb`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/amazon-bill/amazon_order_history.ipynb)    
**Description:** I used numpy in python to analyze amazon data to see how much money I spent on the e-commerce website. (All figures are in rupees.)  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas  
**Results:** Displays a bar graph depicting the amount of money spent on certain years throughout time.

### [Covid Analysis](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/tree/main/SQL/COVID%20Analysis)
**File:**[`SQLQuery1.sql`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online_courseworks/blob/main/SQL/COVID%20Analysis/SQLQuery1.sql)
