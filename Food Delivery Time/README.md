# Food Delivery Time Dataset Analysis

## Roadmap:
### Phase 1: Project Inception

- **Project Idea Exploration:** 
  - Visit the project idea introduced by Fabian Werkmeister at [Project Idea Link](https://lnkd.in/gB6kyeXA).

### Phase 2: Data Preparation

- **Prerequisites Setup:**
  - Install Python 3 on your local machine.
  - Obtain a Kaggle API Key for dataset access.
  - Install necessary libraries: sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib, geopy, scikit-learn.
- **Dataset Acquisition:**
  - Access the Food Delivery Time Dataset on Kaggle using your API key.
  - Download the dataset and store it locally.
- **Database Creation:**
  - Use Python's sqlite3 package to create a database.
  - Create a structured table within the database for efficient data management.

### Phase 3: Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Perform in-depth exploration of the delivery data.
  - Use visualizations to gain meaningful insights from the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Identify and remove outliers to ensure data quality.
  - Store the cleaned data in a new table within the database for future use.

### Phase 4: Modeling and Prediction

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Convert the dataset into a dataframe for further analysis and modeling.

- **Model Development:**
  - Build a Random Forest Regressor model.
  - Fine-tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Assess the model's performance by calculating the error rate.





## Prerequisites 

- **Install necessary Python packages:** The following packages were used, install them using `pip` command to run the program
```bash
    pip install pandas numpy geopy sqlite3 scikit-learn
```
