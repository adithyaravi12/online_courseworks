# Calculate Order History

I used numpy in python to analyze amazon data to see how much money I spent on the e-commerce website. (All figures are in rupees.)


## Procedure

    1. Download report from amazon.in/amazon.com
    2. Import necessary dependencies
    3. Read the downloaded report and store it as a dataframe
    4. Remove any NULL placeholders with 0 using df.fillna(0)
    5. In my document, since the last line was an unnecessary string, I removed the row using df.iloc(:-1,:)
    6. Replace 'Rs.' with a blank string and convert to float
    7. Sum the total
    8. Plot the graph
